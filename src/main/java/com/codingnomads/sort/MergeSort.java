/**
 * Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows:
 * <p>
 * Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing 1 element (a list of 1 element is considered sorted).
 * Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining.
 * This will be the sorted list
 * <p>
